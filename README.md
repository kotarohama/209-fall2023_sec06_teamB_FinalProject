Members: Jason Frankel, Kotaro Hama, Mackenzie Austin, Patrick Xu

Project Concept: We analyzed the generation of values associated with signing free agent players from various analytical perspectives. Users can interact with each visualization and obtain a custom-filtered view to gain better insights and, ultimately, make more informed decisions.

Intended Users: The dashboard is designed to cater to a diverse audience, spanning from casual fans to seasoned experts. It aspires to become a valuable tool for not only fantasy baseball team players but also hold potential utility for MLB general managers.
